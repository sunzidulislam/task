Here is the **full `README.md` (Run Instructions Only)** — specifically for a Laravel backend and Vue.js frontend project organized like this:

# 🚀 Running the Laravel + Vue Monorepo Application

This project is divided into two parts:

- `frontend/` → Vue.js 3 application using Vite
- `backend/` → Laravel 10+ PHP application

Follow these steps to run both parts of the app locally.

---

## ▶️ Step 1: Run the Frontend (Vue.js)

1. Open a terminal and go to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
````

2. Install the Vue dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Vite development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Vue will be served on:

   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

---

## 🛠️ Step 2: Run the Backend (Laravel)

1. Open another terminal window and navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install PHP dependencies using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Copy the example environment file and set up the `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Generate the application key:

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. Set your database credentials in `.env`, then run migrations (if needed):

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

6. Serve the Laravel backend:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

7. Laravel will be served on:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000
   ```

## 🌐 Connecting Frontend to Backend

If your Vue frontend makes API requests to Laravel, make sure you:

* Use `http://127.0.0.1:8000` or set up a proxy in `vite.config.js`
* Enable CORS in Laravel (`barryvdh/laravel-cors` or built-in settings)

---

## 🧪 Tips

* Run both servers **in parallel** (open two terminals).
* Don't forget to add `.env` and `vendor/` in your `.gitignore`.

---

## 📦 Optional Commands

* Laravel DB migration:

  ```bash
  php artisan migrate
  ```

* Vue build for production:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

---

## ✅ Done!

You now have a working Laravel + Vue development setup. Happy coding! 🧑‍💻
